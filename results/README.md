The mnist\_chainer directory contains a fork of a Chainer implementation of CapsNet that we have modified to allow data augmentation.
 Data augmentation takes place in train.py using the Keras image data aumentation object. The results directory contains a large portion 
 of our results excluding some of those from the cnn which are in mnist\_cnn. 
 The reference CNN we used is the example implementation from Keras.
